hello world
another line of code
git hub...



adding some more meaningless lines
for another commit


another few lines
and here you go


updating the default master branch
after b1 branch was created

changes by b2 branch:
adding lines for commit to branch b2

lines for second commit to branch b2
this may lead to clashes


commits by default branch:
updating default master branch after two commits in branch b2
next step should be merging branch b1

time to update from master branch
after another collaborator committed some changes

update master branch after first merge from branch b2

update master branch after pull request from another collborator
